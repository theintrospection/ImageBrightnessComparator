# ImageBrightnessComparator
### A program in order to Compare the brightness difference between two images.

---

Well, as a former Python user, install opencv is too complicated for me. So this program will be implemented without opencv.  
Now I should built the structure of this program.

>1. Main function receives two images as input.

So here comes the problem: what is a image? How many types it has? How should they be handled?  
Now it comes to my first chapter:

#### 1️⃣ **Digital Image**
I'm going start with the most widely used image format --- `.png`

##### **1. So what is `.png`?**
`.png` is an abbreviation of **Portable Network Graphics**.
